# Connected Ashtray

## What is it?

This is a Connected Ashtray that count the number of cigarette in multiple ashtray linked in a webpage that show in live the stat of each ashtray.
The goal is to sensitize people *(mainly in festivals)* to the ecological impact of butts drop no the floor.
We also added led outside the box to track the filling of the ashtray. So the staff can easly see when they have to empty them, and people can easly see where are the ashtray while the nigth.

We was working with Puripungi. This is a society that recycle the butts in recycle material with mushrooms.
